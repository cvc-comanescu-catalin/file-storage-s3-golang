Roles
Now that we have a policy for the tubely app, we need a role to attach it to.

Assignment
Navigate to the roles section of the IAM console
Create a new role called tubely-app
Its trusted entity should be AWS service
Its use case should be EC2
Attach the tubely-s3 policy to it
Now, we’re not actually going to launch an EC2 instance (which is just Amazon’s name for their basic virtual server) in this course. But the next step would be to simply launch an EC2 instance and attach the tubely-app role to it. Then the code running on that server would have the permissions defined in the tubely-s3 policy!

Run and submit the tests.

aws iam list-roles --no-cli-pager

Expecting stdout to contain all of:
"RoleName": "tubely-app"
"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
