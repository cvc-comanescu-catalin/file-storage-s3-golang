Private Bucket
Our tubely bucket is public (remember how we unchecked “Block all public access” in the bucket settings when we made it?).

Public buckets are useful when you want to serve public content directly from them, like user profile pictures, for example. However, you should only use them when you’re certain all the content should be public, and you’re okay with the risks of anyone on the internet using the bandwidth you pay AWS for to download your assets over and over again…

A good use case for a public bucket might be:

Users’ profile pictures
Public certificates of completion (we do this for Boot.dev!)
Dynamically generated images for social sharing (like the link previews you see on Twitter)
While a private bucket might contain:

A user’s privately uploaded documents
A user’s draft content that they haven’t published yet
The org’s video content that’s only available to paying customers
Assignment
Create a new private bucket tubely-private-xxxxx (use a randomish number for xxxxx)
Update the S3_BUCKET environment variable in your local tubely app to use your private bucket instead of the public one
Delete any videos in your admin@tubely.com account - all their URLs will be broken now anyhow
Run and submit the tests.
